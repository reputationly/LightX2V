**LightX2V** is an advanced lightweight image/video generation inference framework engineered to deliver efficient, high-performance image/video synthesis solutions. This unified platform integrates multiple state-of-the-art image/video generation techniques, supporting diverse generation tasks including text-to-video (T2V), image-to-video (I2V), text-to-image (T2I), image-editing (I2I). **X2V represents the transformation of different input modalities (X, such as text or images) into vision output (Vision)**.

We also thank the cloud inference platforms supporting the wider ecosystem:

- [Atlas Cloud](https://www.atlascloud.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=lightx2v) — a full-modal AI inference platform whose hosted API serves the Wan / Seedance / Kling model families that LightX2V also supports, for teams that prefer a managed API over self-hosting.

- [Sensecore](https://www.sensecore.cn/about) —— Sensecore. Build a high-efficiency, low-cost, and scalable AI cloud infrastructure, create a professional deep learning platform and algorithm model system, lead AI innovation, and help industry and academia explore the boundaries of AI.
